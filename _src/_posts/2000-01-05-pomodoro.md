Pomodoro Clock is a **timer application** in which users can divide between their work intervals and break intervals. By default, the pomodoro timer starts at a 25 minute work session followed by a 5 minute break session; however, users can customize the length of each pomodoro, setting their work and break periods according to their personal preferences. The application uses gentle sounds to indicate the start and the end of each session.
