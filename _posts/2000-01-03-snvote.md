snVote is a **voting application** generated with [AngularJS Full-Stack generator](https://github.com/angular-fullstack/generator-angular-fullstack). The application allows registered users to create polls, and share them with anybody. Each poll has a unique link that users can access any time. Rendered with [Google Chart API](https://developers.google.com/chart/), users can view the poll data in a legible manner.
