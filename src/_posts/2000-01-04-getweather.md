Get Weather is a **weather application** built with Javascript and jQuery. Using [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/api), Get Weather allows users to see the weather as well as a five day forcast in their current location. The client renders a different background in correspondence to the temperature for a given location, while the icon changes according to the weather conditions received from the OpenWeatherMap API.
