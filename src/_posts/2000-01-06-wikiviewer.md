Wiki Viewer is a **search application** that uses the [MediaWiki action API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) to perform Wikipedia searches based an the users' queries. A modal search box allows the users to type in their inputs and see the resulting Wikipedia entries. Hovering over each entry reveals a a button linking to the corresponding entry. Users can also click on a button, which will redirect them to a random Wikipedia article.
